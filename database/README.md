# Description

Here we have the logic for interacting with sorobook backend. This inlcudes our defined data structures, logic for making connection to the backend and inserting said data structures into backend.

Soro-Book uses PostgresSql for its backend. The backend manages many different types of soroban data:

- soroban transactions
- wasm contract events
- soroban asset contract events
- ledger info
- contracts basic info
