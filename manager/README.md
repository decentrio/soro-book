# Description

This package defines `Manager`, a `BaseService` that manages all the other sub-`BaseService`. For now the only sub-service it runs is `Aggregation` as we haven't add many other utilities/features to sorobook aggregator. The `Manager` service is triggered by the start cmd of sorobook aggregator.
